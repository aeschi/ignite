# TASKS

## GENERAL

### CONCEPT
We all brainstormed together and came up with a concept that we all thought would be an appropriate topic. We first made mindmaps around the topic of ignite, resulting in a very colorful blend of ideas. But we all stuck with the topic of social injustice. Since we all were trying to educate ourselves with the topic of racism, we decided, that our concept should resolve around discrimination. After talking about it, we figured, that a lot of people are actually unaware of their behaviour, especially in regards to micro-aggressions. So we decided to create an installation to ignite awareness about this topic.

### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE
- We met up multiple times a week and structured our work into different disciplines
- Every discipline has a team captain, I was the captain of team sound

## WEBSITE
- I wasn't part of the website team, but I gave feedback regarding the layout, backend-systems and tested it on different devices

## INTERVIEWS
- I helped with the creation of the questions for the interview for our acquaintances and korientation
- I later edited the interviews (cutting, cleaning) and decided together with the others on how to present them

## INSTALLATION
- we decided together on how we wanted to present the installation
- we looked up different materials together
- we decided together which journey the attendee was supposed to have
- I helped in building the tiny 3d model

## VISUALISATION
- we decided together on how the visuals were supposed to look like and created a mood board together
- Zaini first used Unity to create the visuals and I tried to help her with the VFX-Graph but then everyone decided, that touchdesigner would be a better fit
- I tried to learn and understand touch designer with the help of the tutorials that Zaini sent me, but Zaini was very fast and I could only help a little

## SOUND
- we first created a mood board together and brainstormed how we want the sound to impact the viewer
- I then looked through the different methods of composing a fitting ambience (synthesizers, static sound, etc.)
- thankfully during that time, Felix und Julia came into contact with us, so we decided to show them our moods to give them an impression of what we are thinking of
- during multiple meetings we iterated through the versions and decided on Felix version (microaggressive_sound) to be an incredible fit
- we then organised on how to edit the sound for the future and how to make it responsive
- I helped Zaini implement the sound into the touchdesigner visualization
- I also created a Unity text-to-speech App, that uses an open-source synthesis platform because we wanted some of the sentences to be read out in real time, but since we switched to touchdesigner, it couldn't be implemented yet
- I also made different versions of the soundfile for the trailer 

## CONTENT
- during multiple meetings we brainstormed together what topics and textcontent would be important for us to include in the website
- we then researched through different texts and other websites on the topic, to accumulate a profound collection of ressources (which I am very happy to share if anyone is interested)
- I wrote part of the content that is used in the website

# Conclusion
I had a lot of fun, working on this project. Especially with all the different inputs everyone could give. It was quite the bummer, that we had to do almost everything via Zoom, but none the less, I feel very proud of what the team has accomplished. I can't wait to see the installation(and the team again) in real-life. I also feel, that I learned a lot about the topic and was able to reflect a lot of my previous behaviour that might have been harmful in a healthy manner. I think it is actually extremely important to raise awareness about this topic and I am extremely happy about the endproduct and believe, that this will really help other people to reflect on themselves.
