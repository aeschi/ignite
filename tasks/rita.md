# TASKS

## GENERAL

### CONCEPT
- We developed different concepts in the beginning. 
- I created a system in miro board to guide our brainstorming process.
- I tried to guide the process of looking for an idea. I might be more comfortable with situations when it looks like we are standing in nothing, and it's still not a reason to settle for a shortcut.
- I tried to oversee the project as a whole, and always make sure that the message we are trying to communicate is still clear in every aspect. 
- I initiated some conversations during the process, when we had to clarify ourselves more and more precisely what we are doing and why, who is the target group, how we want the users to feel. 
- I wrote quite a lot of name options for our title, and I participated in the brainstorming as well.

### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE
- I attended almost every group meeting. I tried to be active during the meetings.
- I also attended almost every external meeting, as I've been working closely with Flo doing the illustrations, my friends have been working on the sound, with Klara mostly the 2 of us managed the application for 48h Neukölln, and I also met our future help, Marie, for building the installation.  
- I initiated to apply to 48 hours of Neukölln as well. I looked into what is needed, I created a structure for the application text, we discussed it with Klara, I wrote some part of it, I collected our team's biography, and I created the visuals and the whole look of the presenation for it. I made the hygene plan look nice as well. I checked the whole application, and I supported Klara sending it. 
- I am Captain Installation, which I didn't do too well yet, mostly because I thought as the website team is based on my work with it's visual style, it's better if I do that well first, and realizing the installation can be delayed in time, as that is kind of the last step of our project. 

## WEBSITE
- I looked for inspiration and moods for the website.
- I created the first layout version for the website. 
- I created the second version for the layout.
- I created a mobile version layout.
- I tried several visual directions for the website. It was hard to find a visual language that is fitting the topic, cool enough, and has the sensitivity and makes people emphatetic. And it is abstract enough to make it feel fully inclusive, but understandable enough to be relatable.
- I briefed Flo (our illustrator). I collected visual inputs for him. We had several meetings and chat discussions to find the visual style that is fitting our project and his style and our taste as a group and my taste as well. We had several designs and sketches sent back and forth, rethinking each other's ideas, which was a very interesting process for me. 
- I tried to keep in mind the technical requirements from our team for the designs, which is also a new thing for me, in my job I didn't really have to consider the developer's needs. I tried to help Ellina with how to balance between the technical and design things. 
- I created assets for the website (all the shards). 

## INTERVIEWS
- I used my social network to find applicants for the interviews, 
- I organized time for the interviews, 2 already happened, and 2 are in progress. 
- I participated in 2 interviews. 
- I've been brainstorming about how it is the best to show the interviews. 

## INSTALLATION
- I collected inspirations.
- I made several concept sketches about the installation.
- I consulted with an architect friend about choices of material
- I formed our questions about the space, fireproofeness, regulations and our possibilites to the master of the  Studio.
- I discussed previous installation experiences with Felicia, Phil and Markus.
- With Anna we brainstormed about the installation and we looked into the opportunities of premade structures.
- I've been thinking a lot about how the user experience would be the best for the installation, how can we build and tear down the installation easily, how can we reuse it, how to transport things.
- I've been thinking a lot about how things can go wrong with the installation. I think that is the good and bad part of my education and the experience of building many structures already, that I'm highly aware of the reality of any line I draw (costs, human time, how to build it, possible disasters), which is a unique pessimistic/realistic approach in the team, but which doesn't give the usual free thinking results, that I'm good at. I also tend to go in the simplifying everything direction, which is my general approach in many cases, but also it is realistic, as I'm thinking about the Sehsüchte as a whole, and our human resources for that time frame.
- With Anna we made a projection trial in our flat. And another one in hers to record some videos about them. 
- We created a miniature model with Denise and Anna. 
- I created a floor plan.
- The lockdown is not helping in the installation, I find it very important to touch the materials first and see them in real life. Also getting more projectors and possible spaces to build things is very limited.
- We will keep working on the exact plans for the installation, and when we can have more projectors, we will work on the projection mapping and syncronizing everything.


## VISUALISATION
- I didn't do anything with the visualisation. 
- I suggested to change the visualization colours, after the first projection experiment.

## SOUND
- I invited Felix and Julia to the project. I briefed them in advance, and I tried to find their motivations to help us.
- I took part in most of the sound meetings.
- I looked up some sound moods.

## CONTENT
- I took part in the content meetings. 
- I tried to help in making the content more approachable for people less involved in the topic. 
- I shaped the content into a visual format, breaking it to smaller more comprehensible pieces.
- I proofread the text. 

## CONCLUSION
I really enjoy working on this project, I think we are a super team with a great set of skills complementing each other. 
I didn't choose tasks that are too much out of my comfort zone, which I feel a bit weird about now. On one hand it was good like this, because I felt like that I can contribute to the team the best if I do what I do well, and it is also saving time for everybody. Creating a website design or a visual identity from scratch is not my usual job, so even if I do these things more easily, it is still not easy, and I felt uncomfortable enough, especially trying to think as a group, and not as an individual, or as a brand with an already settled message.
On the other hand, I could have pushed myself a bit more, which hopefully will still happen, when it comes to the projection mapping part, which I'm curious about. 
I'm fully proud of our project, which is also a rare feeling.
