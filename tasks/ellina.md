# TASKS

## GENERAL

### CONCEPT
In the beginning it took quite some time to decide on the topic since all of us have diverse interests. Even though the given word was ignite we decided not to limit ourselves with it and brainstormed freely on different possibilities. It turned out that most common ground for all of our ideas was that project had to be not only fun and artistic but also meaningful and convey an important message. Jack shared his project idea about microaggressions that he had for the other class and we all really liked it. Once the topic was there, we had to decide on the form: I suggested the hybrid format of installation with projection mapping and a website, which I believed would work well for corona times and bring together our skills set. 

### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE
- we were meeting twice a week, some meetings took even more than 3 hours
- was a captain of a website team

## WEBSITE
- created moodboars and list of inspirational websites, which came from awwwards (a website with awards winning websites)
- made a list of technologies to research based on the things I saw were used in these cool wesbites
- researched on each technology and made choices on what to use (took quite a bit of time, but now i'm pro)
- learned firebase, gatsby, framer motion and more of react
- decided on the main layout to be typography-based, one page scroll and so on
- gave my feedback to illustrations and rita's design, for example came up with an idea of section dividers in the form of shards
- developed backend and integrated database
- created a component for users to share their experience and a component for showing these experiences in a list form 
- created basic layout, global styles and template for each section with css code
- gave a basic introduction to react, gastby and best web dev practices to others
- together with Anna intergarted the database with web visualization
- managed github repo, went through pull requests, merge conflicts and reviewed other people code
- turned Rita's design into code: worked on almost every section on the home page, which honestly took a lot of time. In the beginning I really wanted to be true web developer and make it exactly like in the design, but that lead to lots of frustration because our website is quite creative and for example it was really hard to code the text on the shards responsively. We even had a session with Anna's brother who is a senior front-end developer who tried to help me. And css in general is just pain. Sometimes I would find myself whole evening twicking one pixel and gaining nothing in the end of the day. When at some point others helped with coding some parts that was a big relief. Now looking back at it, i wouldnt try to code it exactly as it was in design. I think if I would take design as a reference and not treat it like "let us imagine you are working at web agency and get a brief from designer" from the beginning I would have saved lots of time and would achieve more cool interactions. I think what was also slowing down the process for me that I didnt want to write the code that just works and tried to follow the best practices by watching tones of videos on css on youtube. In the end because of time  pressure I gave up on trying to write perfect code and that made it actually better. 

## INTERVIEWS
- conducted two inteviews 
- asked questions and tried to make people feel comfortable by little off-topic talks
- recorded the sessions, paid attention that interviewes first repeat the questions before answering, so that we can put it together afterwards 
- uploaded inteviews to google folder
- listened to all the other interviews and showed it to my friends for feedback

## INSTALLATION
- particpated in the discussion on how installation should look, the materials, user journey and so on
- could not join Anna and Rita for installation trial because of corona, but very looking forward to build things with my own hands in the future 

## VISUALISATION
- went though touchdesigner file: nodes and comments
- gave feedback on the shape and movement of particles
- wrote a script for exporting the database in json format for visualization 

## SOUND
- i wasn't part of the sound team, but I went though all the tracks and gave my feedback

## CONTENT
- i wasn't part of content team, but I watched videos and read through it and since I had very little background on the topic before the project, I think my feedback was quite valuable in terms of what people we are trying to reach would think 

## CONCLUSION
I'm very happy with our project, and especially with how well we collaborated with each other. From a technical side it was quite challenging for me, but now I feel so much more confident in my web developemnt skills and I actually can't wait to make another wesbite with all the knowledge I gained. I also enjoyed a lot writing code together with others and going through all the pull requests on github. It was so nice to work together with such a talented people and each one of us had something to bring to the table. When I work alone on my projects I usually stuggle the most on the concept and content creation and in the team (cool team like ours) these things became easier, besause there are six brains instead of one.
