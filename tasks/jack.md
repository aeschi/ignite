# TASKS

## GENERAL

### CONCEPT

#### Brainstorming
- Our first group meeting was dedicated to finding out which direction our collaborative project is supposed to take
- First, we tried to figure out if anyone already had a particular project idea in mind or a certain technology/software/device they want to explore, or an overall subject they want to address with this project
- Some of the ideas that were brought in by us dealt with environmentalism and climate change, with sexism, and with racism
- Based on this rather diverse spectrum of topics, we thought about the phenomena of (filter) bubbles, as each of us kind of deals with their very own subjects and problems that others might not relate to
- We tried to figure out a way for connecting all of our ideas and thought about having multiple mini projects in which each of us can implement their idea and sub-topic which would refer to the analogy of enclosed bubbles
- But with having Sehsüchte's theme IGNITE in mind, we thought that those bubbles, despite their differences,  are being put into context by showing the intersectional nature of societal issues and thus, "igniting" an impulse for questioning those circumstances 

#### The Idea

- After the first meeting, I thought about a topic that I think is important to shed light on to and that should be a subject for a broader discussion
- My idea was sparked by BLM and the anti-racist movement that has experienced an incredible dynamic and boost in 2020 through George Floyd's death
- Those events have made me reflect on my own experiences and the discrimination that I and my friends are facing daily and about ways for making this issue visible to those who are not affected by it
- For this, I thought about an audio-visual installation that uses VFX/particles systems to put the visitor in the position of a person who experiences microaggressions
- Inspired by the PGS-class to Particle Systems, projections that mimic a swarm of mosquitoes should frantically surround and orbit around the visitor to evoke feelings of confusion, unease, disorientation and make the emotions that are caused by the experience of microaggression relatable in an abstract way
- On an auditive level, those feelings are reinforced by recorded voices that are verbally committing microaggressions

#### Conceptualisation

- In the following meeting we brought together each of our ideas and the team decided to focus on one topic rather than many smaller ones as we thought that combining our focus on one societal topic would do more justice considering the "seriousness" of them
- The team decided to build upon my proposed idea/concept and as we weren't sure if Sehsüchte is going to be held online or physically, we tried to develop the concept in a hybrid form
- A web presentation seemed quite obvious to us as it can be accessed by everyone who has an internet-ready device and we wanted to include both educative information and a web-based visualisation on the website

### ORGANISATION/ WORK STRUCTURE

- We decided to divide the project into several departments, while each has one team captain that is responsible for organisation and checking the results of people who are part of the department
- I was captain of the content department and initially co-captain of the visualisation team

## WEBSITE

- We all looked for websites or web applications as inspiration for both the visual appearance and the presentation of content about discrimination
- It was the first time using react and gatsby for me, so I began with tutorials and little mini-websites to get familiar with the language
- I implemented and designed the glossary page that should provide a curated dictionary/selection of important and related terms

Both mobile and desktop versions are still in the process of being adapted to responsive design

- I also implemented the navigation/menu of the website
- It is based on a tutorial by Wrong Akram (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqrxiLP9RHz2GxDJaZuTRBw)

- I was also in most meetings in which website devlopment was discussed, e.g.  the design and layout of the website
- Since I was responsible for the content, I also worked closely together with Rita, who was responsible for the design, so we could figure out a layout that works best for the content and vice versa, we also discussed how the visual style should be designed and what feelings/mood should be conveyed


## INTERVIEWS

- We decided to both conduct interviews with individual persons who are affected by discrimination as well as organisations that advocate for the concerns of marginalised groups, so we would include more personal, relatable experiences and a more general, objective perspective
- I conducted two of the personal interviews in the role of the interviewer
- I researched (self-)organisations, collectives, networks, and professionals that are active in fields like LGBTQIA+, BLM, anti-racism, and intersectional perspectives and made a list of possible interview partners
- I was also made responsible for the interview questions for the personal and professional interviews
- I got some input from Anna, Rita, and Ellina for the interview with an organisation
- Also I worked together with Klara Otto for refining the interview with the organisation
- I sent a interview request  to korientation, an organisation, and network of Asian-german perspectives that pursues the goal of giving presence and expression to the diverse realities of Asian-Germans and thus making them more aware and visible
- I am in contact with the organisation and had already had briefing with Dr. Kimiko Su to discuss the project and clarify the interview procedure
- The interview is planned to be conducted next week (KW 7)
- It is also planned to interview more organisations before Sehsüchte to cover a more diverse spectrum of marginalised perspectives such as queer and/or other BPoC groups
- The organisations that are begin discussed for that can be found on the Miro board

## INSTALLATION
- I added moods for possible constructions and the atmosphere we intend to create
- I was not part of the installation planning, but I provided feedback for the visual design and technical implementation

## VISUALISATION
- I was not part of the visualisation department, but I provided feedback for design/technical decisions 


## SOUND
- I was not part of the sound department
- I contributed with moods and provided feedback regarding the role and the emotions that the sound should transport

## CONTENT
- I was made team captain of the content department
- I was responsible for researching, selecting, and writing the information that will be displayed on the website
- We decided to reach a target group with our project that is non-marginalised or has had little to no prior experience or knowledge about microaggressions
- I tried to include particular examples of verbal and non-verbal microaggressions and other forms of discrimination to substantiate a phenomenon that is rather abstract or difficult to relate to
- Another aspect I tried to take into account is the visualisation of hidden communication/meaning of seemingly well-meant comments or gestures and the psychological impact it has despite the - usually good - intention
- Part of the task was also the research and selection of terms that are directly or indirectly related to microaggressions for the glossary on the website
- Denise added some terms to the glossary
- My resources included newspaper articles, interviews, films, poetry from BPoC artists,  anti-racist literature, and studies



## CONCLUSION
- For me it was a great experience to work together with my classmates especially because of how we decided to structure it
- There was no single team leader, but there were many and at the same time we could participate and contribute in any other department and team if we felt like it
- So everyone was able to put in everything the wanted or thought was important
- And the other thing that made working on this project so great, was that it covered a topic which is important to not only me but I think many many other people who might are confronted with microaggressions or with discrimination in general and
- It was amazing to work on a project not only for technical purposes or to create something technically useful, but to raise awareness about societal issues by using our skills and knowledge
